1. Introduction

If you need to automate tasks and processes in the cloud, Cloud Scheduler is a strong and dependable solution that can assist you. Cloud Scheduler is designed to be highly reliable and scalable, and it is backed by the same infrastructure that powers many of Google’s core services. It is also fully integrated with other Google Cloud services, such as Cloud Functions, Cloud Pub/Sub, and Cloud Run, which makes it easy to build and deploy complex workflows and pipelines.

2. What is Cloud Scheduler? Cloud Scheduler is a fully managed service offered by Google Cloud that allows you to schedule and automate the execution of various types of jobs. It can be used to run a wide range of tasks, including those that invoke HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, publish messages to a message queue, or execute command-line scripts.

Cloud Scheduler provides a simple, flexible, and cost-effective way to automate tasks and processes, whether they are simple one-time actions or complex recurring jobs. It is a serverless service, which means that you don’t need to worry about managing infrastructure or scaling resources. Instead, you can focus on defining and scheduling your jobs, and Cloud Scheduler will take care of the rest.

2.1 Why Cloud Scheduler?

There are several reasons why you should choose to use Cloud Scheduler:

1. Ease of use: Cloud Scheduler has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to define and schedule jobs. You can create, view, and manage your jobs using the Cloud Console or the Cloud Scheduler API to automate the process.

2. Flexibility: Cloud Scheduler allows you to schedule tasks to run at specific times or on a recurring basis. You can choose from a variety of scheduling options, including fixed rates, cron expressions, and custom intervals.

3. Scalability: Cloud Scheduler can handle a large number of jobs without requiring any additional infrastructure or maintenance. It automatically scales to meet the demands of your workload, so you can focus on other important tasks.

4. Reliability: Cloud Scheduler is built on top of Google’s global network of infrastructure, which provides high availability and low latency. It also includes robust error handling and retries capabilities to ensure that your tasks are executed successfully.

5. Cost-effective: Cloud Scheduler is a cost-effective solution for scheduling and automating tasks in the cloud. You only pay for the jobs that you run, and you can easily scale up or down as needed.

6. Integration: Cloud Scheduler is fully integrated with other Google Cloud services, such as Cloud Functions, Cloud Pub/Sub, and Cloud Run, which makes it easy to build and deploy complex workflows and pipelines.

2.2 Getting started with Cloud Scheduler:

Now that we know what Cloud Scheduler is and where to use it, this section will go over how to use Cloud Scheduler.

To get started with Cloud Scheduler, you will need to have a Google Cloud account. If you don’t already have one, you can sign up for a free trial here: https://cloud.google.com/free/

Once you have an account, here are the steps you can follow to start using Cloud Scheduler:

1. Enable the Cloud Scheduler API: You will need to enable the Cloud Scheduler API in your Google Cloud project before you can use it. You can do this through the Cloud Console or by using the gcloud command-line tool.

2. Create a job: You can use the Cloud Console, the Cloud Scheduler API, or the gcloud command-line tool to create a job. A job is a task that you want Cloud Scheduler to run on a regular basis or at a specific time. You can specify the schedule for the job, the type of task you want Cloud Scheduler to run, and the target for the task (such as an HTTP endpoint, a message queue, or a command-line script).

3. View and manage your jobs: You can use the Cloud Console or the Cloud Scheduler API to view and manage your jobs. You can view the status of your jobs, enable or disable them, or delete them as needed.

4. Monitor your jobs: You can use Cloud Monitoring to monitor the status and performance of your jobs. Cloud Scheduler automatically writes logs and metrics to Cloud Monitoring, which you can use to track the success or failure of your jobs and identify any issues that might need to be addressed.

That’s it! With Cloud Scheduler, it is easy to schedule and automate tasks in the cloud. You can use it to run a wide range of tasks, and it is fully integrated with other Google Cloud services, making it easy to build and deploy complex workflows and pipelines.

3. Understanding Cloud Scheduler Pricing

§ Till now we went over how to use Cloud Scheduler, now let’s understand the pricing for it. It is a pay-as-you-go service, which means that you only pay for the resources you use. The pricing for Cloud Scheduler is based on the number of jobs you run and the number of invocations of those jobs. It also offers a free tier that allows you to run up to 10 jobs per month at no cost. This free tier is designed to help you get started with Cloud Scheduler and try out the service. But if you’re using beyond that, there are charges applicable.

§ Here is an overview of Cloud Scheduler’s pricing:

Job execution: You are charged for each job execution, regardless of whether the job succeeds or fails. The cost per job execution depends on the duration of the job, with a minimum charge of 1 minute per execution.

Job storage: You are also charged for storing your jobs in Cloud Scheduler. The cost per month is based on the number of jobs you have stored in Cloud Scheduler and the size of those jobs.

API usage: If you use the Cloud Scheduler API to manage your jobs, you will be charged for the API requests you make. The cost per API request depends on the type of request you make.

§ To get a more accurate estimate of your Cloud Scheduler costs, you can use the Google Cloud pricing calculator. This tool allows you to enter your specific usage and get an estimate of your costs based on the current pricing for Cloud Scheduler and other Google Cloud services.

4. Cloud Scheduler Cost Optimization Strategies

There are several strategies you can use to optimize your costs and get the most value out of your investment in Cloud Scheduler:

1. Use the free tier: Cloud Scheduler offers a free tier that allows you to run up to 1,000 job executions and store up to 50MB of job data per month at no cost. If your workload falls within the free tier limits, you can use Cloud Scheduler without incurring any charges.

2. Use the right job type: Cloud Scheduler allows you to choose between different types of jobs, including HTTP jobs, App Engine jobs, and Pub/Sub jobs. Each job type has its own pricing, and some may be more cost-effective for your specific workloads. For example, HTTP jobs are generally cheaper than App Engine jobs, but they may not be suitable for all workloads.

3. Use the right schedule: The cost of using Cloud Scheduler depends on the number of job executions and the duration of each execution. By choosing the right schedule for your jobs, you can minimize the number of job executions and reduce your costs. For example, if you only need to run a job once a day, you can schedule it to run at a specific time instead of on a recurring schedule.

4. Use the right resources: Cloud Scheduler allows you to specify the resources that your jobs will use, such as the number of CPU cores and the amount of memory. By choosing the right resources for your jobs, you can ensure that they are not over-provisioned and are cost-effective.

5. Use quotas and limits: Cloud Scheduler has quotas and limits that can help you control the cost of your jobs. For example, you can use the maximum execution duration limit to prevent jobs from running for an extended period of time.

6. Monitor your usage: Use the Cloud Console or the Cloud Scheduler API to monitor your usage and track your costs. This can help you identify any cost-saving opportunities and optimize your usage of Cloud Scheduler.

By following these strategies, you can optimize the cost of using Cloud Scheduler and ensure that it is cost-effective for your workloads.

5. Best Practice

The GCP Cloud Scheduler is a fully managed cron job scheduler that allows to schedule any kind of job in the GCP cloud. This service acts as a single pane of glass, allowing you to manage all your automation tasks from one place.

This pattern allows you to trigger the deployment of a pipeline’s stage on Azure DevOps using an HTTP call triggered by a GCP Cloud Scheduler service.

The approach is pretty simple:

· The GCP Scheduler is triggered at one specific time

· The execution triggers a Cloud Function

· The CF executes an HTTP call against the Azure DevOps REST API

· The REST API triggers the selected release pipeline

As simple as that! If you want to implement this pattern, you have to define the following stages in your release pipeline:

· Release pipeline to manage the GCP scheduler: to configure the scheduler in GCP. All the code associated to the scheduling and how it calls the Azure DevOps REST api goes here

· Release pipeline to manage the batch infrastructure: to deploy and destroy all the batch infrastructure that runs your batch pipeline

How does this pattern work?

Here is a more detailed view of how this pattern works:

1. Deploy manually the stage to deploy all the trigger required infrastructure:

· A PubSub topic to communicate the Scheduler with the Cloud Function

· A Cloud Scheduler with a given scheduling that will publish an event into the pubsub topic once it is triggered

· A Cloud Function that listens to the PubSub topic and has the code to run the Azure DevOps REST API call

2. Once the CloudScheduler reach the corresponding time, a new message is written on the associated PubSub topic and the CF is triggered.

3. The Cloud Function gets the required security to call Azure DevOps from KMS.

4. Once the security is configured, the CF hits the Azure API making the next stage, Infra Deploy, start running.

At this point in time, your code should be running on top of GCP. Once your code is done, you need to ensure that another message is sent through the Azure API to destroy all the infrastructure via the destroy stage. In this case, you have three different options to implement this call back:

1. Implement a Cloud Function similar to the start process that calls in this case to the Destroy stage of your release pipeline.

2. Reuse the same Cloud Function to implement both stages: create and destroy. You can use the content of the event sent to PubSub to implement the switch in the Cloud Function.

3. Implement the code itself inside your batch processing. This last option is the less recommended because you are coupling your processing with the destruction of your infrastructure. Pick option 1 or 2 if possible.

Things to consider

· The creation and destruction of the infrastructure for the processing is created and destroyed on every execution automatically

· The triggering infrastructure is created manually once and won’t be destroyed while we want the app to be scheduled

· The way we schedule the app is through CloudScheduler using crontab syntax

When to use this pattern

Your data pipeline requires to trigger more activities than the Azure DevOps execution itself. This pattern will allow you not only to trigger the Azure DevOps deployment but also to implement any other activity that must be triggered at the same time than your deployment. You can use the Cloud Function code to implement any other kind of job required to complete your business needs. For example, if you need to trigger your Azure DevOps pipeline to run your data processing and at the same time you have to notify

your web site that the execution has started, you can code that dependency in the Cloud Function provided.

If your data pipeline only needs to be executed at a given point in time, we recommend to use the Azure DevOps Scheduling pattern instead of this one that is simpler to code and configure.

6. Conclusion

Considering the above for managing Cloud Scheduler in your application will certainly help you to save money on your cloud workloads.
