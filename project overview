1. Can you walk me through your experience developing cloud-based solutions using GCP and Azure?
• I have experience designing and implementing cloud-based solutions using GCP and Azure to meet business requirements and improve performance and scalability. I have worked on projects involving data pipelines, data modeling, and automation using Cloud Functions, among other technologies.
2. How do you determine the appropriate cloud platform and services to meet business requirements?
• I evaluate the business requirements and use cases to determine the appropriate cloud platform and services. I consider factors such as scalability, availability, security, and cost when selecting cloud services.
3. How do you ensure the security and scalability of cloud-based solutions?
• I follow best practices for security and scalability in cloud-based solutions, such as implementing access controls, encryption, and monitoring. I also utilize automation and infrastructure as code (IAC) to improve deployment and management of cloud-based systems.
4. What tools and technologies have you used to implement data pipelines, and how have you ensured data quality and integrity?
• I have used tools such as Cloud Storage, Cloud Composer, and Cloud Functions to implement data pipelines. I ensure data quality and integrity by implementing data validation and error handling in the pipelines, as well as by utilizing data encryption and access control.
5. Can you provide an example of a Cloud Function you created to automate data processing tasks?
• Sure, I have created Cloud Functions to automate tasks such as data transformation, file processing, and data ingestion workflows. For example, I created a Cloud Function that triggered an ingestion workflow whenever a new file was added to a specific Cloud Storage bucket.
6. How have you used Log Explorer to monitor and debug cloud-based systems?
• I have used Log Explorer to monitor and analyze logs generated by cloud-based systems, and to troubleshoot and diagnose issues. I have also created alerts and notifications based on log data to be notified of critical issues.
7. What techniques have you used to optimize query performance and storage in BigQuery?
• I have used techniques such as denormalization, partitioning, and data pre-processing to optimize query performance and storage in BigQuery. I also monitor query performance and adjust the data model as needed to improve performance.
8. How do you handle data validation and error handling in data pipelines?
• I handle data validation by implementing checks for data completeness, accuracy, and consistency, and by validating data formats and types. I handle errors by implementing error handling logic and retry mechanisms in the pipelines.
9. Can you walk me through a project you worked on where you had to optimize query performance in BigQuery?
• Sure, I worked on a project where we had to optimize query performance for a large dataset in BigQuery. We implemented denormalization and partitioning techniques, as well as pre-aggregation and materialized views. We also optimized the queries themselves by re-writing them to minimize data scanning and filtering.
10. What strategies have you used to minimize costs in cloud-based solutions?
• I have used strategies such as using reserved instances, auto-scaling, and monitoring and optimizing resource usage to minimize costs in cloud-based solutions. I also consider the pricing models and cost structures of cloud services when selecting them for a solution.
