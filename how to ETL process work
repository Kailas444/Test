For data loading process for Organization and Engagement tables, we will follow two steps 

Bulk/Batch Process 

If Bulk/Batch process fails, then it will perform row by row insert for that batch. 

Step1: Extract the new/updated records from the delta table and load into a Temporary table 

Step 2: Take the count of rows from the Temporary table and divide them equally into batches. 

Step 3: Inside try.... catch block, run a while loop to take the data from each batch 

Step 4: write the merge code inside Begin Transaction....and once the merge code executes successfully then it will commit the transaction and go to the next batch. 

Step 5: If step 4 fails, then the row-by-row insertion will happen using Insert query into the table for the same batch to capture the faulty record. 

Step 6: Once the faulty data found, it should be inserted into Audit table with all the details like (DunsNumber, Error message, Date) 

Step 7: Once the row-by-row insertion completes, then again, the next batch data process will start. 

Step 8: Check the error message of the faulty data and rectify the issue and rerun the Stored Proc.
